        During the university time, I'm interested in research and design mechanics, automation, products and robotics,
        hence <b>Pole Climbing Mechanism (PCM)</b> was proposed as my FYP and completed successfully. Hence, this project
        provide the opportunity in validating my skills in researching, designing and developing mechanism where I 
        have learned these skills in my university time.

    <h2>Pole Climbing Mechanism (PCM)</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        PCM is a mechanism that designed to move along a tube or pipe by carrying payload on it and controlled by phone.
        The payload indicates the tools installed on the mechanism to perform dangerous tasks (inspection, reparing
        and delivering) at high attitude.
        <br>

        <br>
        The PCM can be categorized into active and passive parts, which indicates the motion on each parts. The
        active parts was installed with an actuators and the electrical system . Passive part contribute extra force 
        to hold on the pole. 
        <br>
        FBD was drawn and analysed to perform calculation on force required to move along the pole. calculation
        such as torque requirements, speed, tube bending, friction force were performed.
        <br>

        <br>
        The PCM was fabricated using aluminium AL6061 material, while the customized components were 3D printed.
        FEA analysis was performed on the 3D printed parts to inspect the critical failure points, displacement,
        stress distribution, FOS and other useful information to undergo modification.
        <br>

        <br><br><br>
        While for the controller part, the PCM is controlled using phone. ESP32 was selected as the microcontroller
        of the PCM. The schematic diagram was shown in below.

        <br><br><br>
        Below is the movement of PCM along a vertical pole.

        <br><br><br>
        Besides, the PCM has performed its movement on slanted and horizontal pole with different paylaods too. A graph 
        of payload against speed on different condition of poles was plotted.
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yKEANt/KT_YEOH/main/Photos/FYP/PCM%20Payload%20against%20speed.jpg" width="400">
        <br><br><br>
        From the graph, it is obvious that the payload is "inverse" directly proportional to the payload on PCM.
        The PCM can be installed on a diameter range of pole 110mm to 160mm with a maximum payload of 3kg.

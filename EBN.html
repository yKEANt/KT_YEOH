        <p>The EBN Cleaning Machine in Solidworks</p>
    </div>
    <p>
    This is an Integrated Design Project (IDP) group assignment where students need to research and design
    a industrial related machine to fullfill the cours requirements. Recently, automation in agriculture 
    and traditional sector has a booming scenario where many traditional works have been replace with automated
    machines due to its repeatedly process and actions. Edible Bird Nest (EBN) is a huge potential market where
    nowadays the industry still rely on human labour to complete the cleaning tasks.
    <br>
    Hence, my teammate has proposed a cleaning method to solve this issues as shown below. We have reached out one 
    of the EBN industry, the 
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zenest.zym/" style="text-decoration: none;" class="link_button">OAS Bird Net Industry</a> to understand the EBN industry in terms
    of its challenges, process and market potential.

            The cleaning procedure of EBN
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
        After we have conducted the industrial visit, we finalised and proposed our cleaning method with the supervisor.
        An experiement for our cleaning method was conducted.

    <h2>
        CONCLUSION
    </h2>
    <P>
        Due to the tiem constraint, we only able to research, design and analyse our proposed design based on
        the resources we have. The experiments has brought out an expected outcome, where the EBN is able to
        be cleaned but still need to undergo hand-picking cleaning process. It is challenging to clean the EBN
        up to 100% by only go through 1 cleaning process. Some simulation were done on our design too. It's
        a nice experience to conduct a research and design projects based on the market needs.

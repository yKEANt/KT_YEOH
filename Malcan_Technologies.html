        Malcan Technologies, located at Perai Penang, is a B2B company focusing on researching, designing and developing
        electric bikes and cargo bikes. But we are not designing normal bikes, we are designing bikes that brings
        "smart" feature for you.

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Research and develop electric-bikes that is not existing in the market, where it needs to

            </li>
            <li>Design and optimizing bike essential and critical components. Utilizing 
                DOE methodologies for 3D modelling and engineering bike designs to meet 
                market requirements in terms of functionality (steering mechanism, suspension system, 
                structure, mechanism) and overall appearance.

        An electric longtail cargo bike. As the Lead Product, I have designed and modified 
        the critical components, accessories, products and packaging of the bike. Creating
        and in charge of the BOM where I was requested to communicate and discuss with
        Chinese suppliers on the prototyping, manufacturing and components updates.
        <br>
        In this project, I have been assigned as the Lead Product and also the assistant during
        the product validation at Ningbo, China in a busines trip. In this trip, there's some objectives:
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Solve manufacturing issues and address supplier concerns.</li>
            <li>Assist the CEO during key discussions and engagements.</li>
            <li>Complete pending design tasks.</li>
            <li>Validate the proof of concept for another exciting design.</li>
            <li>Strengthen relationships with suppliers</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>
        EVIE F1 (Developing)
    </h3>
    <p>
        EVEI F1 is an electric front cargo bike that is implemented with a unique steering system along with suspension 
        installed in it. This is the project where I contribute most of my interest, skills, techniques into it. 
        Let me show you why.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yKEANt/KT_YEOH/main/Photos/Cargo%20bike_1.jpg" width="400">
        <br>
        This is a sample cargo bike, where it requires a head tube to achieve a normal bike steering and turning motion.
        <br>
        <img src="https://assets.zeg.de/1050x700/kb140-zbk800.png" width="400">
        <br>
        This is Kettler Cargoline Series, where it doen't require <b>headtube</b> to achieved turning motion with an
        unique steering mechanism. Hence, my challenges are:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Research and design the steering system and suspension system to achieve similar results to conquer bike structure weakness</li>
            <li>Selection and design of critical components (dropout, forging hinge, rocker, torsion bar, tube size, bearing 
                and others)</li>
            <li>Appearance of overall bike to meet market and design requirements</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <b>Key outputs:</b>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Collected steering ratio data based on design requirements through DOE</li>
            <li>Suspension system was proposed and designed under the chassis (vertical space of 80mm, which is the 
                height of the tube)</li>
            <li>Collected market's bike structure dimension and finalised the dimension required</li>
            <li>Overall bike appearance with functional components were designed and ready for overview and manufactured</li>
        </ul>

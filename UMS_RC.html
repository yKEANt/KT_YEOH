        ROBOCON 2021
    </h2>
    <p>
        With limited materials, time, members and without any training before, this is our first time joining the
        national competition. Hence, we were exploring the techniques, equipments and skills on designing and prototyping
        the robots. But the most important is, learn to communicate with each other.
        <br><br>
        A turnable-pneumatic hand gripper is designed to grab the arrow. After the arrow has been turned 360 degree,
        it will be passed to the thrower.

        Unfortunately, the Robocon 2021 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But it was a great experience for us,
        a group of people without any experience to learn all the necessary techniques in building a robot,

        And YES, FINALLY! Our first time joining the national robotics competition, the Robocon 2022! We have accomplished
        our first competition where we have successfully designed, fabricated our robots. We disassembly, packed it in boxes,
        flied through the South China Sea to Penang and assembly the robot again. Yeap, a hectic journey but unavoidable
        proces for the only team from Borneo.

        Marci, is a shooter robot where it has installed with 2 motor shooter to shoot the ball towards the target.
        It has a gripper hand to grab the ball and pass to shooter.

        <br><br>
        Let's talk about Stellar. Stellar's most iconic design is it has a hand gripper like a crab to grab the target 
        (Lagori). It is installed on a turntable bearing to achiece a rotational movement, with a liting mechanism.
        Hence, it is a more complicated robot than Marci.

        <br><br>
        Besides, it has a similar hand gripper as Marci to grab the ball and pass to Marci.

        In this competition, it was a wonderful experience. Even though we didn't achieve what we have targeted,
        but we have achieved what we didn't expected. Something more valueable.

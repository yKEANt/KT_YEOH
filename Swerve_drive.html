        Swerve drive, an AGV system where it can provide higher thrust force compare with omniwheel and mecanum wheel.
        It's consists of 2-DOF. The thrust force of wheel will be directed towards the moving direction of 
        the wheel-base.

        <b>Motors</b><span style="margin-left: 75px;">: BLDC (thrust) and DC (Direction)
        <br>
        <b>Gear for thrust</b><span style="margin-left: 20px;"></span>: Timing belt pulley (1:1 ratio)
        <br>
        <b>Gear for direction</b>: 3D print spur gear (1:2 ratio)
        <br>
        <b>Sensors</b><span style="margin-left: 75px;"></span>: Absolute encoder (to identify current wheel angle)
        <br>
        <b>Wheel </b><span style="margin-left: 80px;"></span>: PU Wheel/Solid Rubber wheel
        <br>
        <b>Completion</b><span style="margin-left: 47px;"></span>: 65%

    <h3>
        Conclusion
    </h3>
    <p>This project is to develop my robotics skills, and contribute some idea in joining robotics competition.
        There's still a lot to touch-up including selection of components and complete calculation for this prototype.
        Besides, this prototype hasn't been tested and progremmed yet. But I did enjoying in designing this project.
